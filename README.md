# MazeSolving_and_PathPlanning
 This project developed a solution for solving 4x4 mazes using the Mycobot Pro 600. The AI Kit's camera captured the maze, detected its entrance, and calculated a straight-line solution path to the exit. The robotâ€™s path was validated in a digital twin before execution, enabling autonomous and precise navigation through any generated maze.
